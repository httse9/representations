"""Wrapper to provide access to the MDP objects (namely, `transition_probs` and `rewards`).

This extends the TabularWrapper, which converts a MiniGridEnv to a tabular MDP.

This iterates through the states (assuming the number of states is given by
width * height) and constructs the transition probabilities. It assumes, like
in the stochasticity setting of our local copy of MiniGridEnv, that the
stochasticity probability mass is distributed evenly across the three actions
different from the one chosen, and staying in-place.
